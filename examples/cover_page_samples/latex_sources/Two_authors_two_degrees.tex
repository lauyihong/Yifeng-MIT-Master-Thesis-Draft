\documentclass[]{mitthesis}
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting it will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads titlesec, enumitem, caption, subcaption - you may edit the mydesign.tex file as you like it.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, lucida
%					 	pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the latex font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.


%%%%%%%%%%%  Metadata  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Most of the document metadata is created automatically. 
% The following items should be adjusted to match your work. <================= !!!!!!!!!!

\hypersetup{%
	pdfsubject={Template for writing MIT theses with the mitthesis class},
	% Change this to briefly state topic of your thesis 
% 
	pdfkeywords={Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT},
	% Add keywords that will help search engines and libraries to find your work.
	% Includes the name[s] of the author[s] 
	% (If you have used \DocumentMetadata, at line 15, you can just put "\CopyrightAuthor," for the names.)
%
	pdfurl={},
	% If you have a url for the thesis, put it here. Otherwise delete this.
	% (MIT Libraries will put your thesis in DSPACE with a persistent url after you submit it.)
%	
	pdfcontactemail={},
	% You can put a [permanent] email address into the metadata, if you like.
	% Otherwise delete this.
%
	pdfauthortitle={},
	% If you have a title, you can include it here.

%%% edit the following commands to match your thesis %%%%%%%%%%

\title{The Atomic Theory as Applied To Gases, with Some Experiments on the Viscosity of Air}

% \Author{Author full name}{Author department}[Author's first PREVIOUS degree][Author's second PREVIOUS degree][...
% Note that third, fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments are optional [] and may be omitted

% note on names: most of the following names are made up; Silas Holman was a professor at MIT in the 19th century.

\Author{Silas W. Holman}{Department of Physics}%[B.S. Physics, MIT, 1876][MBA, Ferengi School of Management, 2022]
\Author{Luisa Hernández}{Department of Research}%[B.S. Mechanical Engineering, UCLA, 2018][M.S. Stellar Interiors, Vulcan Science Academy, 2020][MBA, Ferengi School of Management, 2022]

% Use once for each degree fulfilled by thesis
% For two degrees from one department, leave the department argument blank for the second degree {}.
\Degree{Master of Science in Physics}{Department of Physics}
\Degree{Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering}{Department of Mechanical Engineering}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \Supervisor command for each.
\Supervisor{Edward C. Pickering}{Professor of Physics}
\Supervisor{Secunda Castor}{Professor of of Mechanical Engineering}

% Professor who formally accepts theses for your department (e.g., the Graduate Officer, Professor Sméagol,...)
% If more than one department, use more than once
% If you need to reduce vertical space, put the acceptor title in the second argument and leave the third blank {}.
\Acceptor{Primus Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Physics}{}
\Acceptor{Tertius Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Mechanical Engineering}{}

% In this example, several steps have been taken to make the content fit on the title page! The \Acceptors have been confined to two
% lines in the above commands, the signature block font size is reduced, the skips are tightened, the author names use normal font size, 
% and Luisa's previous degrees are not shown.
\SignatureBlockSize{\small} %\SignatureBlockSize{\footnotesize}
\Tighten
\AuthorNameSize{\normalsize}

% Usage: \DegreeDate{Month}{year}
% Valid degree months are September, February, or June.  
\DegreeDate{June}{1876}

% Date that final thesis is submitted to department
\ThesisDate{May 18, 1876}
