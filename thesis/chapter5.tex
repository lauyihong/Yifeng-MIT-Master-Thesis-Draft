% Section Headers Only - To Be Written Later
% ============================================

\section{Synthesis: Connecting Extraction and Reasoning}

\hl{[How Part 1 pipeline output feeds into Part 2 Graph RAG; end-to-end vision; why evaluated seperately]}


\section{When to Use Graph RAG}

\hl{[Decision framework for practitioners; query complexity threshold; corpus size considerations; cost-benefit tradeoffs]}


\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Synthetic vs. Real Data Evaluation}

\hl{[Part 2 uses synthetic data; validation on real MA data as future work]}

\subsection{Pipeline Generalization}

\hl{[Tested on one county; other regions may have different doc formats]}

\subsection{Query Parsing Brittleness}

\hl{[V1 to V2 improvement shows sensitivity; more robust NLU needed]}


\section{Future Work}

\hl{[Integration of pipeline + Graph RAG; scaling to full 9000 doc corpus; real-time querying interface; other legal document domains]}
