This thesis was conducted as part of the Massachusetts Covenants Project and benefited from the support and collaboration of its affiliated agencies, as well as the Data + Feminism (D+F) Lab at MIT.

The evaluation component of this work relied on multiple data sources. In the control group, 110 real geolocation data points were obtained through manual searching and proofreading of archival materials from past UROP projects. The original real-world images and deed review data from the North Middlesex Registry of Deeds were compiled by Wonyoung So, whose prior work provided an essential foundation for this study.

This project also received support from the MIT course \textit{11.458 Crowd-Sourced City} (Fall 2025). The end-to-end pipeline developed in Part I was fully designed and implemented by the author. Additional support was provided by Mingyang Sun (MCP ’26), particularly in the management and development of OpenStreetMap API integrations and parts of the evaluations.

I am grateful to all collaborators, instructors, and institutional partners whose contributions made this research possible.
