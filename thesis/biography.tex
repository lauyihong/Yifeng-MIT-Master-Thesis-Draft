\chapter*{Biographical Sketch}
\pdfbookmark[0]{Biographical Sketch}{biosketch}

Yifeng Liu is pursuing dual Master's degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: a Master in City Planning (MCP) from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SM EECS). His research focuses on the intersection of urban informatics, machine learning, and spatial analysis, with particular interest in leveraging computational methods to address urban inequality and housing policy challenges.

Prior to MIT, Yifeng developed expertise in [prior education and experience - to be filled]. His interdisciplinary approach combines technical skills in natural language processing and knowledge graph construction with substantive knowledge of urban planning and housing policy.

This thesis emerged from Yifeng's participation in MIT's Crowd-Sourced City course (11.458), where he collaborated with MassHousing and the Leventhal Map and Education Center on the Massachusetts Covenants Project. The work represents his commitment to developing computational tools that make historical archives accessible for research and policy analysis.

Following graduation, Yifeng plans to continue work at the intersection of technology and urban policy, focusing on applications of machine learning and spatial analysis to support equitable urban development.
